# Capacitor Plugin Converter

This is a *experimental* CLI tool under heavy development that allows for the following:

1. To read Plugin.m and Plugin.h files and modify your Plugin.swift file to allow them to be removed
2. If those are your only Objective-C files, you will be able to generate a Package.swift to make your plugin
3. With that complete, you can test your plugins with the new experimental SPM support
