# Capacitor Plugin Converter

This is a *experimental* CLI tool under heavy development that allows for the following:

- To read Plugin.m and Plugin.h files and modify your Plugin.swift file to allow them to be removed
- *COMING SOON:* you will be able to generate a Package.swift for your plugin to be useable with Capacitor SPM
